Instructions for Lab 5 of NETS1035

Use Veracrypt to create a 5MB volume in a file named veracrypt-studentnumber (using your student number of course) with the password omgThe5eme$ter!54lmostdon3 and mount that volume so you can use it.

On this disk, there are 21 image files. Each file has a number for its name, from 0 to 20.

You are going to create a PDF named ourSecret with a sequence of images in it.
Your student number is your key to selecting images and the ordering of those images for your PDF. Use the images on the VeraCrypt volume that has this readme file on it.

Select the image that matches the first digit(s) of your student number, then the image that matches the next digit(s), and so on until you have a sequence of images representing your complete student number.

e.g. if your student number is 200342016:
         you would use images 20, then 0, then 3, then 4, then 20, then 16 in that order

The PDF must only contain images. No text of any kind is to be in the file.
If you need to shrink the images to keep your PDF under 4MB, then do that.
Place your PDF and each of the original image files you used for the PDF, and only the images you used to make your PDF, on your veracrypt-studentnumber volume. Add an image or meme that shows how you feel about finishing your last lab of this course to your veracrypt-studentnumber volume. Dismount that volume.

Submit your dismounted veracrypt-studentnumber file as an attached file for lab 5 under Assignments on Blackboard.
