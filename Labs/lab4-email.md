## Sending email for marks

   * one plain email with the subject "pgp public key" with only your pgp public key in an attachment
   * one that is signed and has the subject "signed example" containing an interesting image along with a text caption or description of the image
   * one that is encrypted and has the subject "encrypted example" containing a different interesting image along with a text caption or decription of the image
   * one that is signed and encrypted and has the subject "signed and encrypted example" containing a third interesting image along with a text caption or decription of the image
