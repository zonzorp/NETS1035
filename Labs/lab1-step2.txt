1. Remove the encryptedHash and encrypted instructions files from the random directory they were put in
2. Generate a random message by using a random number generator on your system to produce 128 bytes of random binary data and create a sha-256 bit hash of the data
3. Base64 encode the message
4. Encrypt it with aespipe, using a 20 character random password created using data from your system's random number generator
5. Submit your pdf showing the steps you took in the first task, and your second task's encrypted file and put the password for it and the sha-256 hash for the original random data from step 2 in the comments for this lab on blackboard

When I decrypt and decode your file, I will be testing the content to see if you put real random data in it and have the right sha-256 hash for it. Both must be correct to get the marks for this task.
